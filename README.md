# Pewlet-Hackard-Analysis
Analysis of mock HR data from an HP-like company to generate actionable insights on the upcoming wave of expected retirements throughout the organization, or 'silver-tsunami'.

## Results

* Over 50,000 senior staff (engineers & miscellaneous staff) will be retiring as part of the 'silver-tsunami'
* Fortunately, only 2 managers are set to retire and will need to be replaced
* 1,550 employees will be eligible for the mentorship program, to help train the younger generation of staff
* 670 of these eligible employees are engineers, which is fortunate as they will be required to assist in training over 40,000 newly hired engineers to ensure PH's workforce remains capable.

## Summary

After looking over our data, we've found that 90,398 employees will be retiring in the upcoming year. PH will need to look towards filling these roles rapidly to mitigate the risk of affecting their operations in any significant way.

PH is definitely underequipped to implement their planned mentorship program -as only 1,550 employees are eligible for the staff mentorship program when they retire, their current mentor:mentee ratio would be 1:58 (1,550:90,398), which does not seem feasible to foster any sense of understanding.
